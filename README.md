## Expresiones regulares - Proyecto/Taller Matematicas Discretas
El funcionamiento principal del programa se basa en la Identificación de Expresiones Regulares analizando 
archivos de texto en busca de patrones específicos que ya han sido previamente definidos haciendo uso de expresiones regulares. 
Facilitando asi la identificación y extracción de información relevante encontrada en los archivos 
de texto que se han usado para la comprobacion del programa o que el usuario proporcione.
## Textos utilizados:
En el programa se ha hecho uso de tres archivos de texto diferentes para realizar el análisis y la búsqueda de patrones específicos. 
A continuación, se encuentran los nombres de los archivos con su respectivo enlace utilizados:
